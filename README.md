# Modular Machinery Addons

**Modular Machinery Addons** is an addon to [Modular Machinery: Community Edition (MMCE)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modular-machinery-community-edition) Which helps to give pack designers more ideas, designs, and recipes with several hatches that integrate the world rather than just a simple item or fluid. This also brings those same connections to several other mods when installed such as **Blood magic, Thaumcraft, and Nuclearcraft.**
